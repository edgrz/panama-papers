# PANAMA PAPERS

## PREPROCESSING

This is an R Markdown document which processes $Panama Papers$ released by ICIJ[1]. Specifically, it parses relationship `csv`. 

`all_edges.csv` file contains all relationships that has been stablished between each kind of node. Each relation falls under one of three relation types, namely *registered_address*, *intermediary_of* and *officer_of*. However, *officer_of* has specific subtypes and so we are going to normalize terms:

```{r cars}
edges <- read.csv('all_edges.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
cat("Rows:", dim(edges)[1])
cat('Cols:', dim(edges)[2])
```
File can be inspected:
```{r}
str(edges)
summary(edges)
```
Then we can check there is no null values:
```{r}
colSums(is.na(edges))
```
As stated, there are three kind of relationships:
```{r}
occurrences <- table(edges$TYPE)
occurrences
```
If we focus on $link$ column which contain relationship subtypes:
```{r}
occurrences <- table(edges$link)
occurrences
```
There are 33 kinds of relationships, 31 of them are subtypes on *officer_of*. In order to simplify graph and the subsequent analysis, we will normalize subtypes which has less than 30 occurrences as *officer_of*. It's contribution to probability distribution is extremely small compared with the total amount of existing relationships.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
newd <-  edges %>% group_by(link) %>% filter(n()>30) #
occurrences <- as.data.frame(table(newd$link))
occurrences
```
Filtering by subtypes which has more than 30 occurrences,we ended up with 6 kind of relationships. However, *beneficional owner of* and *beneficiary of* can be merged as one, as they refer to same concept:

```{r}
array <-  as.vector(occurrences$Var1)
edges_parsed <- within(edges, link[ link == "beneficial owner of"] <- 'beneficiary of')
edges_parsed <- within(edges_parsed, link[ !(link %in% array)] <- 'officer_of')
```

```{r}
new_occurrencies <- table(edges_parsed$link)
new_occurrencies
```
Following neo4j admin import documentation[2], relationship CSV must contain 3 mandatory column fields:

  1. START_ID — ID refering to a node.

  2. END_ID — ID refering to a node.

  3. TYPE — The relationship type.

We are going to overwrite 2nd column with values processed on $link$ dataframe column:
```{r}
edges_parsed$TYPE <- gsub('_',' ', edges_parsed$link)
edges_parsed$TYPE <- edges_parsed$TYPE
```

CSV export:
```{r}
write.csv(edges_parsed, file = "edges_parsed.csv",row.names = FALSE)
```
